saveMassPlot_fromPico.py
this makes the full mass plot, as in Fig 32 of ANv6. Make sure to run on all years

makeDiphoCutPlot.py
This makes the mass plot, pass and fail, as in Fig 33 of ANv6

makePlotAndPico_EWindows.py
makes energy window plots of different particles, 2D of mass v energy, 2D of mass v delta R, delta R plot, mass plot in e30 - 60. 
Then, makes a cut on 30 < e < 60 and deltaR < 0.15. Saves pico tree
Plots corrspond to ANv6, fig 34, 35, 36, 37

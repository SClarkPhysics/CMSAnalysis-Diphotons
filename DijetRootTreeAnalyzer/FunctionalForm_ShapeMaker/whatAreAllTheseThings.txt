dscb_fitKnown.py 
Fits a double sided crystal ball to every known signal, X and alpha shapes. It saves the plots in FitPlots/ and saves the parameters from the fits in fitparams_x.txt and fitparams_alpha.txt

dscb_fitSystematics.py
Fits the X shape for all known signals for four systematics, PU, PD, SU, SD. Saves params in SystematicFitParams/PU/fitparams.txt

makeEfficiencies.py 
Reads in efficiencies from unbinned known signals, makes a tgraph, interpolates. Saves plots in EffPlots/inputs/ . Saves efficiencies in InterpoParamFiles/Eff/FULL.csv

plotSystematicParams.py
Does the same as above, but for the systematic shapes, only in X. Outputs are saved as text files for each parameter in InterpoParamFiles/Systematics/PU/paramname.txt. Output plots in ParamPlots/Systematics/PU

MakeShapes.py
Creates the Functional Forms for all new signals in a loop before alpha binning. Output is saved in ../inputs/Shapes_fromInterpo/unBinned/XxxxAaaa

MakeShapes_Condor.py
Creates the Functional Forms for one new signal. Call as MakeShapes_Condor.py 600 0.005   (args are xmass, alpha)

getAlphaEfficiency.py
Does the alpha binning from the unBinned shapes. Reads in alpha shapes, computes integral in alpha bin, saves if enough signal survives. Output is saved in
../inputs/Shapes_fromInterpo/alphaBinning/ . Also creates a text file AlphaFracs/fracs.csv that computes and compares the integrals between known and generated shapes


Full workflow would mean running: 
dscb_fitknown.py (~10 min)
dscb_fitSystematics (~10 min) 
makeEfficiencies.py (instant)
plotSystematicParams.py (3min)
[All the above should only need to be run once. Now you can play around with making the shapes]

python MakeShapes.py
python getAlphaEfficiency.py

or

python MakeShapes_Condor.py XMASS ALPHA
python getAlphaEfficiency.py

Analysis stuff: 


plotEfficiencies.py
After shapes are made, run this to plot the alpha efficiencies for the known and interpolated signals. This is diagnostic. Ideally, there will be a nice smooth curve. I have not seen this yet... Plots
are saved in EffPlots/alphaBin##
